# RPPL Insights (RPPL Visualizer v2.0)

The **RPPL Insights (RPPL Visualizer v2.0)** platform is a fully modular, ELA-aligned data visualization system designed for secure research environments such as Stronghold. This version introduces a construct-driven architecture, modular chart pipelines, stronger local security via a custom Python server, and support for multiple interactive chart types including radar charts, trends-over-time line charts, milestone threshold charts, and scatterplots, all operating on locally stored survey data aligned to the ELA Instructional Framework.
